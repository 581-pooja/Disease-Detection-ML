# Heart, Kidney and Diabetes Disease Detection using Machine Learning

Problem statement : 
- In today's time, we see a lot of the shortage of doctors in the world, especially in India. A lot of people are suffering a lot without the help of the proper medical checkup. Due to Lockdown and Covid, people need a website or way to detect that there are chances of happening a disease or not so that people or even doctors can put details of the report of disease and Model will predict the chances of having disease and using that user may consult the doctors as soon as possible. So to cope up with all of those problems this app is designed which would prove its benefits up to much extent.
- To remove the dependencies on the doctors 
- To help out the poor and helpless people with the medical checkup 
- To extend the role of technology in the medical field


## About:
- The website will have an About Page containing information about all the diseases i.e. Heart, Kidney, and diabetes, and Web pages with respect to each disease user have to put report information, and model will predict the results based on input. Using a Machine learning model is developed for each disease . 
- The project's purpose is to produce an online health checkup facility to reduce the dependencies on the doctors, to help out the poor and helpless people with the medical checkup, and to extend the role of technology in the medical field HealthCare. 
- Heart, Kidney, and Diabetes Disease Detection website will use machine learning to predict the results, it is an end-to-end website deployed using Azure Cloud services.
- The whole project is deployed on Azure Cloud using Azure Web servies: https://khd-disease-detection.azurewebsites.net/
